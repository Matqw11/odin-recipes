<p><h3><em>Directions</em></h3>
    <strong>First, make your way to Uganda;-)</strong>
    <ol>
    <li>A mug or cup  must be used to mix the ingredients together.</li>
    <li>Mix two or more eggs in the cup to make an egg mixture</li>
    <li>Cut 1 onion, 1 tomato, slice quarter of a cabbage</li>
    <li>Add the above ingredients in the egg mixture</li>
        <li>Add a pinch of salt as well in the egg mixture and stir</li>
            <li>the egg mixture must be poured onto a hot, well-oiled pan and spread out with a spoon to spread the mixture.</li>
                <li>Once the first side is cooked, flip the eggs over. They should be lightly browned.</li>
                    <li> The bottom side will brown less – but you’ll be able to see those pretty ingredients…</li>
                        <li>While the eggs are still in the pan, top them with a large chapati. The steam coming off the eggs will soften the chapati.</li>
                            <li>Then you can remove them. Make sure the chapati is at the bottom, so as to roll the egg in the chapati</li>
                            <li>Then Serve</li>
    </ol>
